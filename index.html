                <p>It greets us at dawn and sets sail at dusk.</p>
                <p>It is what we dread in the summer and relish in winter.</p>
                <p>At the heart of our solar system, the sun provides us with energy that powers our everyday lives.</p>
                <p>But how does this happen?</p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <div class = 'container'>
                <p>The sun's core contains billions of atoms of the universe's lightest element.</p>
                <p>Hydrogen nuclei come together to form helium nuclei, and release a tremendous amount of energy in the process.</p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <div class = 'container'>
                <p>But hold on,</p>
                <p>Aren't hydrogen nuclei positively charged? How could nuclei possibly collide without repelling each other?</p>
                <p>You might think that, since these particles move at incredible speeds -- around 500 km/s,
                    and that the sun's density is so high, that the particle collisions happen extremely frequently.</p>
                <p>So even if only a tiny fraction of collisions are successful, surely this would overcome this barrier?</p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <div class = 'container'>
                <p>As it turns out, the number of successful collisions is effectively <b>zero!</b></p>

                <p>When you think about it, it makes sense. In school we learned that forces between 
                    subatomic particles are the strongest forces in the universe.</p>
                    <div class = 'hover'>
                        <span>(Do you recall the name of this force?)</span>
                        <p class = 'hidden'>It's called Strong Force!</p>
                    </div>
                <p>Theoretically, when these nuclei come together, there must be something that is holding back these strong forces.</p>
                <p>Clearly, the sun is still producing massive amounts of energy, so some sort of physics-defying process is at play.</p>
                <p>And there is! Kind of...</p>

                    <span>You see, there's this theory that has boggled the minds of the greatest physicists for <b>years</b>.</span>
                    <p class = 'hidden'>We are still investigating how some of its properties work to this day!</p>

                <div class = 'hover'>
                    <span>And here is how it <b>actually</b> works...</span>
                    <p id = 'hidden'>The barrier that holds back these nuclei from fusing together is known as the Coulomb barrier, and
                        as explained before, it is created when the protons repel each other at long distances.  However, when 
                        two nuclei approach each other, scientists have observed that one of the nuclei ‘tunnels’ through the Coulomb barrier 
                        and reaches the other side. <br><br> When this happens, the forces holding the protons together ‘breaks’ and thus, releases massive
                         amounts of energy. This phenomenon is known as Quantum tunneling.
                    <br><br>In fact, when we observe objects at an atomic level, the familiar classical physics rules don't apply anymore: nuclei ignore electrostatic forces (quantum tunneling), 
                        electrons behave like both a wave and a particle (photoelectric effect), and groups of seemingly unrelated atoms are changing state simultaneously even though they are physically far apart (quantum entanglement). </p>

                <p>We are using this knowledge in our everyday life too: nuclear power is based on fusing Uranium’s nuclei together to create energy, 
                    the photoelectric effect inspired the creation of fibre optics, and quantum entanglement is one of the fundamental building blocks in quantum computing.</p>
